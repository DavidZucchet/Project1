# Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

1. Proportion of women in the Tech field?
2. Age distribution to start programming in women compared to men
3. Women programs as a hobby? And men?
4. Being a Women has an impact on salaries on tech-jobs?

# File Descriptions
There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here (https://davidzucchet.medium.com/understanding-the-participation-of-women-in-the-tech-industry-f9ccbd0b30d7).

# Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data and Udacity for the learning path in the DataScientist Course and some of the code that I reused. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available here (https://www.kaggle.com/aitzaz/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2020). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
