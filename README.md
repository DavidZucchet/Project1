# Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

1. Proportion of women in the Tech field?
2. Age distribution to start programming in women compared to men
3. Women programs as a hobby? And men?
4. Being a Women has an impact on salaries on tech-jobs?

# File Descriptions
There are 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here ().

# Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data and Udacity for the learning path and some of the code reused. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available here (https://www.kaggle.com/aitzaz/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2020). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
